# Ruby-Ceasar-Cipher

This is a Ceasar Cipher built in Ruby as practice to help cement more of the Ruby language in my head, as well as the help me think more algorithmically.

# Acknowledgements

The specifications for this project came from TheOdinProject. I got help from the Ruby Docs, as well as the ever knowing and often wrong Stack Overflow.
